Project Name: Werkstatt Infinite

The Pitch: A hyper-functional, infinite-canvas bullet journal that strictly adheres to "form follows function," offering a distraction-free space for architects of thought.

The Twist: The "Snap-to-Bauhaus" Grid. While the canvas is infinite, the background features a dynamic, high-contrast grid (in Gray #808080) that subtly encourages your "ballpoint" strokes to align with geometric precision. The UI uses massive, blocky buttons (Brutalist style) in Blue #006392 for navigation, but the writing experience feels analog and raw.

Tech stack & Key specs:

Language: Kotlin (Native Android) for maximum stylus/touch latency reduction.

Graphics Engine: Skia or OpenGL to handle the infinite canvas rendering without lag.

Database: Room (local first) with encrypted cloud backup.

Specifics: Custom ink engine simulating distinct ballpoint friction curves.
