## DEBUGGING

1. When you press the button clear it erases all, so you can't undo.
Suggestion: change the clear button that erases all to a erase button that erases the last strokes, freely like a paintbrush.

2. Add option to zoom in/out of the canvas, either with two fingers or with a zoom slider.

3. Add option of typing into the canvas with keyboard. (with option to change the size and to move it and color)

4. Add option to import photo in .jpeg or .png format. Add option to export canvas in .jpeg or .png format.

5. Add a dotted grid as the 3rd option in the toolbar.

6. BUG! When you swipe back to the list of canvases(dashboard), it closes the app.

7. When you are in the list of canvases(dashboard), the title of the canvas is in white and the box is white too. Suggestion: change the color of the background to red, yellow or blue(bauhaus themed) or the color of the letters to one of those colors, whichever is eaiser.

8. Suggestion: Add the option to have just one list of all canvases(dashboard) and it opens the list as it is now, so you can have more canvases in the same "folder" which can be named.

9. Toolbar in canvas mode the button list takes you to the list of the canvases(dashboard) that exist in the same "folder". When in list of canvses there is just + New Canvas , add arrow to go back to the main dasboard.
