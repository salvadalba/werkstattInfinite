## TWEAKS

### Important

1. Get rid of the text on the bottom of the canvas(toolbar)using only icons.
2. Toolbar should have more spacing between the icons or the icons should be smaller. The last icon is shrinked at this moment.
3. Photo import option should be added. jpeg or png format.
4. Photo export option should be added. jpeg or png format.

### Additional

1. Add an option to manipulate the imported photo. Suggestion resize. Maybe when the photo is imported it should be shrinked to fit the canvas.

2. Add a two finger option to move around the canvas.

3. Suggestion a cursor option on toolbar to manipulate the imported photo and/or canvas too.  

### Debugging

1. Problems with import is that the photo is imported randomly and cannot be manipulated it's stays where it is imported.

2. Export the whole populated area, add optional extra features regarding size (now auto, 1:1).

### Debbuging

1. It's not smooth as before, would the autosave time to 120seconds help? The autosave is not as important as the smoothness.

2. When imported the photo is out of the white canvas, my guess is that the white canvas is right bottom and when i import the photo it goes on the center of the surface of canvas as we said, but i think the white canvas should be on center.

3. The movement manipulation of the canvas when the photo is imported is sluggish and is slow, we should compromise with smooothness and speed as the most important thing.

### Additional suggestion

1. The eraser should work on the photo aswell. Either the whole photo or the strokes.

### Success

The export works as we planned it's all popoulated.

----

### Debbuging

1. The smoothness still not there, try maybe downsampling by 4x?
2. Always when you import the photo it goes left upper side of the canvas and it overlays the title of the canvas (bug)

### Additional options

1. Eraser should two functions, one erase whole photo. Second Erase strokes.

### Success

The export works as we planned it's all popoulated.
