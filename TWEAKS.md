## TWEAKS

### Important

1. Get rid of the text on the bottom of the canvas(toolbar)using only icons.
2. Toolbar should have more spacing between the icons or the icons should be smaller. The last icon is shrinked at this moment.
3. Photo import option should be added. jpeg or png format.
4. Photo export option should be added. jpeg or png format.

### Additional

1. Add an option to manipulate the imported photo. Suggestion resize. Maybe when the photo is imported it should be shrinked to fit the canvas.

2. Add a two finger option to move around the canvas.

3. Suggestion a cursor option on toolbar to manipulate the imported photo and/or canvas too.  

### Debugging

1. Problems with import is that the photo is imported randomly and cannot be manipulated it's stays where it is imported.

2. Export the whole populated area, add optional extra features regarding size (now auto, 1:1).
